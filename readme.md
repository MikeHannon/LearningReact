# These are code snippets from various react tutorials with my own comments and statements.
I will try and put a summary of the time that it took me to finish the code in the tutorial as well as what I learned!

1) Project 1: Tyler McGuiness's egghead.io(pro) react course
- npm install webpack, react, react-dom, babel, babel-core, babel-preloader, babel-preset-es2015, babel-preset-react, react-router, history

- So far there have been some unclear parts of the tutorial, where Tyler jumps around a bit: e.g. we do a bunch of installs some of which we don't use right away, but in those instances why not just add react-router at the same time?

- In addition, he is using ES5 notation, rather than ES2015, so I am adjusting on the fly.
